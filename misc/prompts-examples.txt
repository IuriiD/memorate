Ask 2 multi-choice questions to the following text and mark the correct answer with "*"

prompt engineering is a emerging discipline within the world of generative Ai and it describes the art of writing good intentional prompts that produce an output from a generative AI model that we actually want and to a degree it is an R it's it's very hard to explain how to create a good product but to a larger extent there's a very logical process and way that we can go into creating problems that can be described and easily applied to produce better output from large language models and of course the generative art tools as well good prompts are the key to producing good outputs for these models using different types of prompts we can modify the mode or type of task that has been formed and we can even use prompts to train models to some degree and the performance of doing that is actually surprisingly good now there's a few things to learn with prompt engineering and I think one of the best ways to maybe think about this discipline is to think of it as a more abstract version of programming so throughout the last decades we've seen programming languages become more and more abstract prompts for AI models is almost like the next step it's a super abstract programming of an AI model and that's exactly how I want to approach this here I want to discuss prompts and building good prompts of AI model.

In the following text find the sentences which correspond to the following phrases: 
1. An artificial intelligence chatbot developed by AI startup OpenAI
2. Mykhailo Fedorov
3. To work in dialog mode

Ukraine has been removed from the list of countries where the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT is blocked. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov announced this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports. "ChatGPT is now available in Ukraine. The team of the Ministry of Digital Transformation worked for a long time on this decision - official letters, calls and a meeting with the management. Finally, we managed to correct the injustice. Ukraine was removed from the list of countries where ChatGPT is blocked," he wrote. The program will not work only in the territories temporarily occupied by Russia. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by AI startup OpenAI and capable of working in dialog mode, which supports requests in different languages.
